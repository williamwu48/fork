# my-first-repo
A repository for learning GitHub.
My name is Vincent Wu. I like playing video games, driving, and playing basketball. I am currently learning on how to code in Java. I have a brother named Willaim Wu. He also likes to play video games and basketball. He could be a little annoying sometimes, but he is helpful.
